# Python OpenAI Realtime Voice Library

This library is meant to be used for real-time voice API with websockets, similar to how the [official openai javascript library works](https://github.com/openai/openai-realtime-api-beta).

# Usage

An example of usage is in `examples/relay-server` which mimics the behavior of relay server from the [official openai realtime console example](https://github.com/openai/openai-realtime-console).

I am also working on an example that uses [reflex](https://reflex.dev/) for the frontend and should have a working example soon.
